# Development Setup DWM

This is my development setup that automatically installs all of the tools and window manager I like to use with it's own keyboard shortcuts.

I am trying to make the scripts work on a lot of different distro's so that it does not matter which distro I choose.

This setup was inspired by ThePrimeagen's My setup is much better than yours course on Frontendmasters.

I really enjoy learning things from ThePrimeagen's courses, they're very informational and very well explained.


I've also taken inspiration for the ricing of my system from:
- [dwm + rofi](https://github.com/siduck/chadwm)
- [st](https://github.com/siduck/st)
- [grub](https://www.pling.com/p/1482847/)

On tumbleweed I haven't yet figured out how to build the st terminal configuration and the asciicam.
