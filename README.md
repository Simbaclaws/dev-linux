# Development Setup DWM

This is my development setup that automatically installs all of the tools and window manager I like to use with it's own keyboard shortcuts.

I am trying to make the scripts work on a lot of different distro's so that it does not matter which distro I choose.

This setup was inspired by ThePrimeagen's My setup is much better than yours course on Frontendmasters.
- [dev](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/dev)

I really enjoy learning things from ThePrimeagen's courses, they're very informational and very well explained.


I've also taken inspiration for the ricing of my system from:
- [dwm + rofi](https://github.com/siduck/chadwm)
- [st](https://github.com/siduck/st)
- [grub](https://www.pling.com/p/1482847/)

For the colorscheme, I'm a big fan of Radium.
- [Radium nvchad theme](https://nvchad.com/themes)

I'm not nessecarely a big fan of nvchad as in the entire configuration. 
Some parts of it are pretty nice, I like the visual appeal.

## Tested Distributions

The following distro's have been tested:

### - Pop OS (working)
I don't yet have a wallpaper for pop os. There are wallpapers for different OS'es under the wallpapers folder.
Preferably I get all of them working, but that's just a dream.

### - Ubuntu (working)

## Neovim Configuration

I'm still learning how to use neovim, so please be gentle when judging my configuration, I'm quite new to this.
I'm taking inspiration from [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/) as well as [Josean](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files)

### - Neovim (semi-working)

I still have some errors in my configuration, and I haven't done everything I wanted to yet.

Some things are just fun in the terminal, which is why I included them in the repo.

### - Asciicam (working)
